## DESCRIPTION

This application is working with a MERN stack to build a working Book search engine. My biggest challenge was learning how to properly work Apollo server to route all the correct queries and mutations. I had a lot of issues trying to navigate the resolvers mutations, and to how to properly set up mutations and queries files on the client side. All in all, this was a good project in practicing how to build a full stack application, and I still have much more to learn!
